\arguments{
\item{report}{is a logical parameter indicating whether or not a
PDF report is produced using knitr.  Default is FALSE.}

\item{use.SAS.RData}{is a logical parameter indicating whether or not a SAS.raw.RData file
already exists in the data directory and do not need to be generated again. Note that
SAS.raw.RData is an output of the function \code{\link{process.HyperSAS}}.  Default is FALSE.}

\item{use.COMPASS}{is a logical parameter indicating whether or not the azimuth difference
between the sun and the view geometry is calculated using the SAS compass data. Default is FALSE
because compass usually don't work on ship. When FALSE, the azimuth angle difference
is taken from the cast.info.dat file.}

\item{DIAGNOSTIC.PLOTS}{is a logical parameter indicating whether or not diagnostic plots are saved in PNG format.
It is used only when TYPE="TRANSIT".
The plots shows the temporal variability in Ed and tilt,
as well as the spectra for each Ed, Li and Lt recorded during the data acquisition.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{COPS}{is logical parameter to force the water reflectance to pass through the COPS
reflectance measurements made a priori. It must be turn on only if COPS data have been
processed and validated}
}
\description{
This function launches the HyperSAS data processing,
which constists in calculating the hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance (Rrs)
from radiometric measurements performed using a Satlantic HyperSAS system. It processes
data files found in each directories specify in the file named directories.for.HyperSAS.dat.
The TYPE "STATION" or "TRANSIT" need to be specify for each directory in the file
directories.for.HyperSAS.dat. It depends whether the directory gather replicates of Rrs
of the same station, or the data collected along the course of a ship transit.

For each directory, the logging information must be stored in an
ASCII file named cast.info.dat. Note that the HyperSAS file were previously
processed from raw to L2 using ProSoft and exported to ASCII format (*L2.dat).
}
\details{
First when HyperSAS.go is executed, it reads a file named directories.for.HyperSAS.dat
in the working directory from which \code{\link{HyperSAS.go}} was launched.

Second, in each folder found in directories.for.HyperSAS.dat, the program will look for a
file named cast.info.dat. This file contains the logging information need to process each *L2.dat
The cast.info.dat file contains the information on viewing geometry, windspeed,
dark current file, as well as processing parameters such as the quantile probility,
the maximum tilt tolerance, the "white correction method" to eliminate sun glint, foam,
ocean spray etc. In details, the following 11 fields should be found in cast.info.dat:
Year (YYYY),
Day (JDAY),
Time (HHMMSS),
Dphi (DEGREE),
ThetaV (DEGREE),
Windspeed (d.d),
Wind.units ("m.s", "Kts", "Km.h" or "Km/h")),
quantile.prob (0.5 to 1),
tilt.max,
NIR.CORRECTION ("Mobley+NONE", "Mobley+NULL", 'Mobley+SIMILARITY1', "NIR", "UV", "UV+NIR" or "Kutser" or "COPS"),
good (0 or 1).

Finally, the function \code{\link{process.HyperSAS}} will be called to process each data folder.

about the processing parameters of the cast.info.dat file listed above.
