\description{
This routine compute AOPs from in-water hyperspectral
measurements performed using HyperOCR radiometers deployed
at the water surface with an arm and (optionaly) with a
tripod. Four set-ups have been implemented so far:
}
\details{
1. Upwelling radiance near the air-water interface (i.e. Lu0) and
downwelling irradiance at depth Z (EdZ). Tripod set up.
2. Upwelling radiance near the air-water interface (i.e. Lu0) and
upwelling radiance at depth Z (LuZ).
3. Upwelling radiance near the air-water interface (i.e. Lu0) only
4. Upwelling irradiance near the air-water interface (i.e. Eu0) only


   The HOCR set up needs at least on sensor looking down just beneath
   the air-water interface. It could be either a radiance sensor (Lu0) or
   an irradiance sensor (Eu0). If the set up uses a Lu0 sensor, you must
   provide the depth at which the sensor was submerged using the parameter
   Lu0.Depth. For example, if the Lu0 sensor was lowered at 10cm below the
   surface, Lu0.Depth = 0.1. If the set up uses a Eu0 sensor, then
   Eu0.Depth must be provided.
   NOTE: non-NA is therefore mandatory for Lu0.Depth or Eu0.Depth. This
   depth will be used to apply a correction to retrieve Lu0- or Eu0-. This
   correction needs an estimation of the diffuse attenuation coefficient
   for the upwelling radiance Lu or irradiance Eu (K_Lu or K_u).
   In the set up #1 ( Lu0 and EdZ sensors available), Kd is estimated
   using Ed0+ and EdZ sensors, and KLu=Kd (only true in opticaly deep water).
   In the set up #2 (Lu0 and LuZ), K_Lu is computed from the measurements

   In the set up #3 and #4, K_Lu or K_u can only be approximated using the
   measured IOPs. No correction will be apply is IOPs are not provided.

   If Lu0 is provided, then the code will compute Rrs=Lw/Ed.
   If Eu0 is provided, then the code will compute R=Eu/Ed.


   IMPORTANT: The instrument self-shadow correction has not been
   implemented yet.
