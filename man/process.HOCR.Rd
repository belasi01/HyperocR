\description{
This routine compute AOPs from in-water hyperspectral
measurements performed using HyperOCR radiometers deployed
at the water surface with an arm and (optionaly) with a
tripod. Three set-ups have been implemented so far:
}
\details{
1. Upwelling radiance near the water surface (i.e. Lu0) only
2. Upwelling radiance near the water surface (i.e. Lu0) and
downwelling irradiance at depth Z (EdZ)
3. Upwelling radiance near the water surface (i.e. Lu0) and
upwelling radiance at depth Z (LuZ).
