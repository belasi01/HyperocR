\description{
This programe will read the log file and process every file
foung in the log file. The files must be put in the same folders
(e.g., ../dat/). The output will be save as PNG and RData.
The user can provide IOPs to estimate the K_Lu or K_u in order to make
the extrapolation of the Lu0- measured near the sea surface
(typically around 10 to 15 cm from the sea surface).

 @param log.file is the name of the ASCII file containing the
